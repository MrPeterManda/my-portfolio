        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
            My name is Peter Manda and I am a passionate software developer with a 
            strong desire to create meaningful solutions that have a positive impact 
            on people's lives. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool to 
            address real-world challenges and I am excited about the possibilities it offers.
        </p> 
        <p>    
            I have a solid foundation in Python and Java programming, as well as a basic 
            understanding of other languages such as C, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. 
            I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions, and I am always 
            eager to learn and improve my skills to become a more effective developer.
        </p>
        <p>  
            What really drives me is the opportunity to create software and web solutions that 
            empower people to achieve their goals and pursue their dreams. Whether it's a mobile 
            app that simplifies a complex task, a web platform that connects people with the resources 
            they need, or a tool that helps organizations operate more efficiently, I am committed to 
            creating solutions that are user-friendly, reliable, and effective.
        </p>  
        <p>
            In my free time, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and expand my 
            knowledge in the field of software development. Specifically, I am keen to learn more 
            about DevSecOps and the tools and techniques that are used in this area. I find it 
            fascinating to explore the intersection of development, security, and operations, and 
            to see how these disciplines can be integrated to create more secure and efficient 
            software systems.
        </p>    
        <p>   
            Some of the tools and technologies that I am interested in learning more about include 
            Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, Ansible, Jenkins, GitLab, and Terraform. 
            I believe that these tools can play a critical role in DevSecOps and can help to 
            streamline the development and deployment process while also improving security and 
            reliability.
        </p>
        <p>   
            Overall, I am a curious and enthusiastic learner who is always eager to explore new 
            technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in 
            software development.
        </p> 
        <p>   
            If you're looking for a dedicated and skilled developer who is passionate about 
            creating meaningful software and web solutions, I would love to hear from you!
